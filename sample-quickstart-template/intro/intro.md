# Introduction

## About this LiveLabs QuickStart

Messy data buries meaning. Keywords miss the mark. Customers, employees, and analysts waste time chasing the right document, product, or answer.

AI Vector Search in Oracle Database 23ai fixes that. It stores embeddings—the numeric “fingerprints” of meaning—inside the database. With them, you find what things mean, not just what words they contain.

This QuickStart shows how to:

Run similarity searches with distance functions that capture nuance.

Power real applications—document search, recommendations, and image matching—directly inside the database.

Use simple code examples to build smarter search and discovery into your own systems.

Why it matters: Vector Search lets companies unlock hidden value in data, serve customers faster, and build intelligence into every workflow—all without leaving Oracle Database 23ai.
